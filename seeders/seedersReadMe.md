# Seeders

Seeders directory is used to store the all seeder files

The seeder file in **Sequelize** is used to populate your database with initial or test data. It allows you to insert predefined data into your database tables during the development process.

The main purposes of using seeders are:

**Populating initial data:** You can use seeders to insert initial data into your database tables when you set up your application. This can include default configurations, reference data, or sample records that are necessary for your application to function properly.

**Testing and development:** Seeders are useful for creating consistent test environments. They allow you to populate your database with test data to ensure that your application behaves correctly in various scenarios. Seeders can also be used during development to quickly populate the database with sample data for testing and debugging purposes.

**Database versioning:** Seeders are typically used in conjunction with migrations. While migrations handle the structural changes of the database schema, seeders handle the initial data population. By combining migrations and seeders, you can version and manage both the database structure and the initial data in a controlled and repeatable manner.

Overall, seeders provide a convenient way to populate your database with data that is necessary for your application's functionality, testing, and development purposes. They help you maintain a consistent database state and simplify the process of setting up and managing your database during different stages of your application's lifecycle.
