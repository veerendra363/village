# Migrations 

Migrations in the context of web development and databases refer to a way of managing and versioning changes to your database schema over time.  

In simple terms, a migration is a file or a set of files that contains instructions on how to make changes to your database schema, such as creating tables, modifying columns, adding indexes, and more. Migrations are typically written in a specific format or using a framework-specific tool(In this project we are using sequelize ORM for migrations).

Migrations directory is used to store only migration files.
